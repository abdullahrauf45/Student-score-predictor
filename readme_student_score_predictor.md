# üéì Student Exam Score Predictor

A futuristic Streamlit web app that predicts student exam scores based on uploaded datasets or manual input. The app automatically cleans your data, detects the exam score column, and trains a linear regression model to make predictions. Perfect for teachers, students, or anyone looking to estimate performance! üöÄ

## ‚ö° Features

- **CSV Upload**: Upload any dataset with student information.
- **Auto Data Cleaning**: Removes useless columns, fills missing values, and drops empty columns.
- **Automatic Target Detection**: Detects columns like `exam`, `score`, `marks`, `result`, or `grade` as the target.
- **Linear Regression Prediction**: Trains a model and predicts exam scores based on input features.
- **User-Friendly Input Form**: Input student information via sliders and dropdowns.
- **Futuristic UI**: Gradient backgrounds, glowing headers, and animated buttons for a modern look.

## üìÅ Dataset Guidelines

- CSV format.
- Include features like study hours, attendance, or other student metrics.
- Target column can be named `exam`, `score`, `marks`, `result`, or `grade`.
- Avoid completely empty columns or irrelevant IDs/names (though the app auto-removes them).

## üé® Styling & UI

- Futuristic gradient background with animated color shift.
- Glowing headers and buttons.
- Modern font: Orbitron.
- Smooth hover effects on buttons.

## ü§ñ Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Numeric columns: missing values filled with mean.
  - Categorical columns: Label Encoding.
  - Irrelevant columns dropped automatically.
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20

## üìå Future Improvements

- Add other regression models like Random Forest, XGBoost for better accuracy.
- Allow saving/loading trained models for faster predictions.
- Interactive visualization of predictions vs actual scores.
